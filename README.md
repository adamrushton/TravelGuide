### **Description:** 
An advanced, professional looking travel application that allows you to view weather conditions from a wide range of cities. Updating details from a live weather service, OpenWeatherMap using their API. The application stores 12 countries with 5 major cities, including the capitals in the android SQLiteDatabase all of which have image hyperlinks to their Wikipedia pages and images links that displays their location on Google Maps. The application also allows users to add/remove countries and cities to their favourites, with country and city listings with information relevant to corresponding city/country. All countries and cities can be sorted in their individual displays by name, code and population with the country also listing the area code, so it can be sorted by that as well. Sorting supports both ascending and descending. Users can also write and store custom notes for each country.
